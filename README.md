# Overview

**C2 Malware Traffic Response Solution Pack** provides a set of investigation and utility playbooks to respond to C2 attacks.

In such attacks, the malware-infected system connects with the attacker's server (C2 server) to maintain communication with the infected system. The attacker uses such attacks to gain control over the system, steal data, or download other malicious software.

The solution pack includes a scenario that demonstrates the containment and investigation procedures once the outbound connection attempt using a known C2 port is detected.
